## <u>Idea and Foundations</u>

Founders Jack Zhang and Max Li were looking for a side-hustle to supplement their day jobs and opened a coffee shop; ***Tukk & Co***. For this, they ordered take away coffee cups and labels from China to reduce costs.

The process, timeliness, high exchange rates and exorbitant fees was 'painful' They soon realised that it was the same for other small business owners.

 > "We had ordered a big batch of takeaway cups from China because importing them was much cheaper than buying locally, but when it came time to pay the invoice I was shocked at how badly we were getting fleeced on the foreign exchange rate and fees" Mr Zhang

They, thus, set up AirWallex to provide small businesses needing to make cross-border payments with a cheaper alternative to the banks or the likes of Western Union and Paypal.

# Business Activities


### <u> ***Financial Problem*** </u>

International payments have high fees and transaction costs, especially for small and medium enterprises, as they do not have the bulk to receive discounts.

They also need to work with local banks to convert the currencies and  manage forex rates  which fluctuate minute to minute.

The process also takes many days to complete

The transfer process is managed through correspondent banking network (supported by the SWIFT messaging protocol and largely unchanged since the 1970s).

In practice, businesses that use this service are subjected to high-fees, slow-processing times, minimum transaction sizes and volume limitations.
There is also breadth and depth of compliance screening in terms of  KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and CTF (Counter-Terrorism Financing).

The process is so complex that only a few banks are able to maintain the relationships and compliance that international transfer through correspondent banking requirements.

This means that huge profits pool between a few players, resulting in limited internal pressure to change the system for the customer’s benefit.

Australian regulators estimate customers could have saved $150 million in fees in 2018 if they had used less costly services than those provided by the four largest banks: National Australia Bank (NAB) Commonwealth Bank (CommBank), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Westpac (WBC).

###  <u> AirWallex Solution</u>

The AirWallex proprietary platform allows users to set up overseas bank accounts for businesses in other countries. This allows customers to pay in their local currency and using their preferred channel like mobile money, local transfers and country specific payment methods like WeChat.

With machine learning and data transparency practices they providing the customers with interbank forex rates, forex rate lock in and best payment route.

This can reduce costs for businesses by as much as 90% based on traditional foreign exchange rates, resulting in fees of less than 1%.

The company also provides APIs to this platform allowing companies to build payment ecosystems and also integrate payment and receivables into automated processes and accounting systems.

Recently AirWallex started issuing virtual cards in partnership with Visa and has launched a loyalty programme.

###  <u> Customers</u>

The primary customer base for AirWallex are Ecommerce companies that sell globally. AirWallex allows them to receive payments in local currencies.
By using their local bank account, their customers can participate in local marketplaces like Amazon, EBAY, Catch which require a local bank account.

They are also targeting service companies, travel companies and agencies. With their virtual card & wallet offerings, these companies can issue virtual cards towards spend management and receipts to global team members

With their API platform, AirWallex is working with technology companies to provide them a single payment and receivables platform. These companies can integrate global payments into their offering or platform. With the platform, they can programmatically open global accounts, issue virtual cards, manage forex, make and receive payments.

####  <u> Addressable Market / Market Analysis </u>

As per the McKinsey Global Payments map, the global payments industry is estimated at approximately **US $ 1.9 trillion** at the end of 2020 (reporting).This takes into account the shrinkage due to COVID 19 Crisis.

Selling on digital global marketplaces is driving up merchants’ payments-acceptance costs, which are expected to rise by an incremental $8 billion to $15 billion (about 6 to 10 percent) as commerce migrates to these higher-cost channels.

Just as importantly, merchants also face higher decline and fraud rates on digital transactions, with ramifications for customer experience.

AirWallex's major business is from and to China.
 **[China's cross-border payments]** rose 30.6% in 2019 to RMB 34 trillion (US$4.8 trillion), according to the People's Bank of China. Cross-border payments are rising in tandem with cross-border e-commerce. From 2015-2018 China's cross-border e-commerce grew at a compound annual rate of 76%, according to a report published in late 2019 by consultancy Deloitte, the China International Chamber of Commerce and Alibaba's AliResearch.

> "Merchants are willing to
accept higher fees for demonstrated value, such
as improved authorization rates, a more seamless
payments experience, or improved cart conversion
through point-of-sale financing." McKinsey

> "Australian consumers purchase the equivalent of over AUD40 billion in foreign currency each year and further competition in the supply of FX services has the potential to deliver significant savings for consumers in relation to those purchases, both in aggregate and for individual consumers" ACCC

# Landscape

###  <u> B2B Payments Domain </u>

AirWallex's offerings are primarily in the B2B cross-border payments and receivables domain.
This allows their customers to seamlessly receive and pay money in the countries they offer their goods and services.
Having local accounts, a company can offer multiple localised payment options to their customers.

###  <u> Trends and Innovation </u>

* Managing currency risk: Currency exchange rates change on a minute by minute basis. There are also bank holidays and weekends when the markets are not available. The use of machine learning has brought better forecasting capability to enable forex rate locking and improved hedging.

* Forex rates and fees: Availability of forex was very difficult due to volume and fees. Technology companies started offering transparent interbank  rates to customers directly with low fees.
  
* Settlement time: In the past 3-5 years, settlement time i.e. time from when the payment is made to when it is received has substantially decreased. International payments today arrive in one business day. Digitally built networks have assisted here.

* Digital Identity and Onboarding: Proofed digital identity, digital signing and identity exchange standards have allowed organisation to quickly onboard customer and authenticate identities. This has also made digital detection of forgery possible; at scale.

* Digital Payments: The growth of digital payments globally has allowed quicker and convenient recovery of dues and also settlement of payments
  
* Cloud: Cloud technologies have enabled such fintech companies to quickly expand and roll out their services in multiple markets, globally.
  
* API Driven Platforms: The rise of API Driven platforms has allowed Fintech companies to specialise in Financial offering thus improve them. They are then able to use their APIs to engage the larger Financial ecosystem.
